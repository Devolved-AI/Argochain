Code of Conduct
===

Hey there! As a community-driven project, we want to make sure everyone
feels welcome and valued when participating in Argochain. To achieve 
this, we've created a set of guidelines for behavior and communication 
that we call our Code of Conduct.

### Our Principles
-------------------

These principles are based on the [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/) by 
Contributor Covenant. We're all about:

*  **Respect**: Be kind, considerate, and respectful to others. This 
means respecting people's time, opinions, and identities.
* **Inclusion**: Make sure everyone feels included and valued in our 
community.
* **Openness**: Keep the lines of communication open by listening 
actively, asking questions, and clarifying expectations.
* **Fairness**: Treat others fairly and with an open mind. No 
assumptions or jumping to conclusions without evidence!

### What You Can Expect
-------------------------

As a member of the Argochain community, you can expect:

* Respectful interactions from others (and us too!)
* Open communication that fosters collaboration and learning
* A welcoming environment where everyone feels valued

### Consequences
-------------------

If someone's behavior is found to be in violation of this Code of 
Conduct, we'll take the following steps:

1. **Verbal warning**: We'll give a gentle reminder if someone's 
behavior is off-track.
2. **Written warning**: If the behavior continues, we'll send a written
notice.
3. **Temporary suspension**: In extreme cases where the behavior is 
severe or persistent, we may temporarily suspend participation in 
Argochain activities.
4. **Permanent suspension**: If the behavior causes harm to others and 
doesn't improve, we may need to permanently exclude someone from our 
community.

### Reporting Incidents
---------------------------

If you experience or witness any incidents that violate this Code of 
Conduct, please report them to [reporting contact information]. We'll 
handle all reports promptly and fairly.

Thanks for being part of the Argochain community! Let's work together 
to create a fun, welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and 
can contribute without fear of harassment or discrimination.
