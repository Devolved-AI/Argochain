## 🚀 Running a Single Node

After setting up your development environment, you're ready to spin up a single Argochain node. This is great for solo development and testing, letting you dive into the core features of Argochain without the complexity of a full network.

### 🛠️ Starting the Node

- **Navigate** to your Argochain directory:
  ```bash
  cd Argochain
  ```
- **Build** the Argochain node. This compiles the necessary binaries:
  ```bash
  cargo build --release
  ```
- **Launch** the node in development mode:
  ```bash
  ./target/release/argochain --dev
  ```

### 🤖 Interacting with the Node

- You can interact with your node using the **Substrate Frontend Template**, **CLI tools**, or **RPC calls**, depending on your development needs.

## 🌐 Deploying a Testnet

When you're ready to take things to the next level, deploying a testnet is your next step. This simulates a more realistic network environment and is perfect for testing interactions between nodes.

### 🛠️ Setting Up Testnet Nodes

- **Configure** each node with the necessary keys and settings for networking and consensus.
- Start your **bootnode** (the initial node in the network) with:
  ```bash
  ./target/release/argochain --chain=staging --name=BootNode1
  ```

### 📡 Adding More Nodes to the Testnet

- Launch **additional nodes** and ensure they're configured to connect to the bootnode using the `--bootnodes` option along with any other necessary configurations.

### 🔍 Monitoring and Maintaining the Testnet

- Use **telemetry**, **logging**, and **metrics** to keep an eye on your testnet's health.
- Stay on top of **updates** and **network issues** to keep your testnet running smoothly.
