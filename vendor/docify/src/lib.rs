//! Docify provides a simple set of rust macros, namely [`#[docify::export]`](`export`) and
//! [`docify::embed!`](`embed`), that allow you to dynamically embed tests and examples at
//! compile time from elsewhere in your workspace directly within rust docs comments, with the
//! option to make these examples runnable.
//!
//! The intent behind docify is to allow you to showcase your best examples and tests directly
//! in your docs, without having to update them in two places every time there is a change. It
//! also encourages a methodology where crate authors better document their tests, since they
//! can now showcase these directly in their doc comments.
//!
//! All-in-all this is a much better workflow than having doc examples isolated within your docs,
//! since you can avoid boilerplate from the surrounding code and just focus on showcasing the item
//! you want to highlight.
//!
//! ## General Usage
//!
//! Using `docify` is simple. First mark the tests/examples/items that you wish to embed with
//! `#[docify::export]`, such as the following:
//!
//! ```
//! #[docify::export]
//! fn some_example() {
//!     assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
//!     assert_eq!(2 + 3, 5);
//!     assert_eq!(3 + 3, 6);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can then embed this item directly in doc comments using the `docify::embed` macro:
//!
//! ```
//! /// These are some docs about an item. You can embed examples, tests, and
//! /// other items directly into docs using the following macro:
//! #[doc = docify::embed!("examples/samples.rs", some_example)]
//! /// More docs can go here, the example will embed itself inline exactly
//! /// where you reference it.
//! pub struct SomeItem;
//! ```
//!
//! This will result in the following expanded doc comments:
//!
//! ```
//! /// These are some docs about an item. You can embed examples, tests, and
//! /// other items directly into docs using the following macro:
//! /// ```ignore
//! /// fn some_example() {
//! ///     assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
//! ///     assert_eq!(2 + 3, 5);
//! ///     assert_eq!(3 + 3, 6);
//! /// }
//! /// ```
//! /// More docs can go here, the example will embed itself inline exactly
//! /// where you reference it.
//! pub struct SomeItem;
//! ```
//!
//! You can embed any item capable of having an attribute macro attached to it.
//!
//! ## Runnable Examples
//!
//! Note that you can also use the [`embed_run!`](`macro@embed_run`) version of the macro to
//! make the embedded example compile/run as part of doc tests, which is desirable in certain
//! situations even though typically the example will already be running/compiling somewhere
//! else in your project.
//!
//! ## Dynamic Embedding in Markdown Files
//!
//! A newly added feature allows compiling entire directories of markdown files with HTML
//! comments that contain regular [`docify::embed!`](`macro@embed`) calls. See
//! [`compile_markdown!`](`macro@compile_markdown`) for more info.
//!
//! There is a live example of this as well in `README.md` where this same sentence appears in
//! the root of the repo. `README.md` is dynamically generated when `cargo doc` is run based on
//! the contents of `.README.docify.md`.
