/// A heap implementing a WebAssembly linear memory.
///
/// Code compiled from WebAssembly runs in a sandbox where it can't access all
/// process memory. Instead, it is given a small set of memory areas to work in,
/// and all accesses are bounds checked. `cranelift-wasm` models this through
/// the concept of *heaps*.
///
/// Heap addresses can be smaller than the native pointer size, for example
/// unsigned `i32` offsets on a 64-bit architecture.
///
/// A heap appears as three consecutive ranges of address space:
///
/// 1. The *mapped pages* are the accessible memory range in the heap. A heap
///    may have a minimum guaranteed size which means that some mapped pages are
///    always present.
///
/// 2. The *unmapped pages* is a possibly empty range of address space that may
///    be mapped in the future when the heap is grown. They are addressable
///    but not accessible.
///
/// 3. The *offset-guard pages* is a range of address space that is guaranteed
///    to always cause a trap when accessed. It is used to optimize bounds
///    checking for heap accesses with a shared base pointer. They are
///    addressable but not accessible.
///
/// The *heap bound* is the total size of the mapped and unmapped pages. This is
/// the bound that `heap_addr` checks against. Memory accesses inside the heap
/// bounds can trap if they hit an unmapped page (which is not accessible).
///
/// Two styles of heaps are supported, *static* and *dynamic*. They behave
/// differently when resized.
///
/// #### Static heaps
///
/// A *static heap* starts out with all the address space it will ever need, so it
/// never moves to a different address. At the base address is a number of mapped
/// pages corresponding to the heap's current size. Then follows a number of
/// unmapped pages where the heap can grow up to its maximum size. After the
/// unmapped pages follow the offset-guard pages which are also guaranteed to
/// generate a trap when accessed.
///
/// #### Dynamic heaps
///
/// A *dynamic heap* can be relocated to a different base address when it is
/// resized, and its bound can move dynamically. The offset-guard pages move
/// when the heap is resized. The bound of a dynamic heap is stored in a global
/// value.
