= common-path

https://docs.rs/common-path[Documentation]

A small crate that provides functions for determining the common prefix, if any, between a set of paths

== Installation

In your `Cargo.toml`, add this to the `[dependencies]` section:

----
common-path = "1"
----

and in your crate root, add

----
// src/lib.rs, src/main.rs, etc
extern crate common_path;
----

== Usage

There are two functions provided: `common_path`, and `common_path_all`

----
extern crate common_path;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let a = Path::new("/a/b/c/d");
    let b = Path::new("/a/b/e/f");
    let prefix = common_path::common_path(a, b); // => Some(Path::new("/a/b"))
}
----

If you need to find a common prefix for more than 2 paths, `common_path_all` takes anything that can be turned into an iterator of `Path` references:

----
extern crate common_path;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
    let a = Path::new("/a/b/c/d");
    let b = Path::new("/a/b/e/f");
    let c = Path::new("/a/g/h/i");
    let prefix = common_path::common_path_all(vec![a, b, c]); // => Some(Path::new("/a"))
}
----

=== Notes

This library makes no attempt to canonicalize the paths, so 2 paths that should *theoretically* have a common prefix might get missed unless they are canonicalized beforehand.

For example, `/foo/bar/baz` and `/foo/quux/../bar/baz/quuux` should have the common prefix `/foo/bar/baz`, once they are canonicalized, but in this form, this library will return a
prefix of `/foo`. If you call `Path::canonicalize` on them beforehand, you will get the "correct" prefix, but `canonicalize` will return on an error on paths that don't actually exist,
so I wanted to avoid using it in this library.
