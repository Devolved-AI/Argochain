//! [`<bin> complete`][CompleteCommand] completion integration
//!
//! - If you aren't using a subcommand, see [`CompleteCommand`]
//! - If you are using subcommands, see [`CompleteArgs`]
//!
//! To source your completions:
//!
//! **WARNING:** We recommend re-sourcing your completions on upgrade.
//! These completions work by generating shell code that calls into `your_program` while completing.
//! That interface is unstable and a mismatch between the shell code and `your_program` may result
//! in either invalid completions or no completions being generated.
//! For this reason, we recommend generating the shell code anew on shell startup so that it is
//! "self-correcting" on shell launch, rather than writing the generated completions to a file.
//!
//! Bash
//! ```bash
//! echo "source <(your_program complete bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
//! ```
//!
//! Elvish
//! ```elvish
//! echo "eval (your_program complete elvish)" >> ~/.elvish/rc.elv
//! ```
//!
//! Fish
//! ```fish
//! echo "source (your_program complete fish | psub)" >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
//! ```
//!
//! Powershell
//! ```powershell
//! echo "your_program complete powershell | Invoke-Expression" >> $PROFILE
//! ```
