# Load Testing with JMeter: Report for WebSocket Connection

Load testing is a critical aspect of performance testing, aimed at evaluating how a system behaves under high load conditions. 
For this report, we used Apache JMeter, a popular open-source testing tool, to conduct a load test on a WebSocket endpoint wss://explorer.devolvedai.com. 
This endpoint represents a connection to a blockchain-based service, allowing real-time communication and data transfer.
